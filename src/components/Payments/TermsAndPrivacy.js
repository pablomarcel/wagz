                        <h1>Community Payments Terms</h1>
                        <p>These Community Payments Terms (the "Terms") govern your use of the payment features (the "Payment Services") of Wagzters (the "Platform"). By using the Payment Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms are a part of and are incorporated within our Terms of Service.</p>
                        <h2>1. Payments Overview</h2>
                        <p>Our Payment Services allow you to use our Platform to make payments to us, other users, and for products, services, donations, subscriptions, and features offered through our Platform.</p>
                        <h2>2. Payment Methods</h2>
                        <p>When you make a payment on the Platform, you agree to provide a valid payment method. Your transactions will be processed through our payment partners, which may require you to provide additional information including your name, credit card number, expiration date, and security code.</p>
                        <h2>3. Purchases and Donations</h2>
                        <p>Payments made for purchases, donations, and subscriptions are final and non-refundable unless otherwise determined by us. When you make such transactions, you agree to abide by any relevant terms and conditions applicable, including shipping, payment, and delivery policies.</p>
                        <h2>4. Fees and Charges</h2>
                        <p>There may be fees and taxes that are added to the price of the services and products you purchase. We or our payment partners may also charge you certain fees relating to the processing of your payment method.</p>
                        <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
                        <p>Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.</p>
                        <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
                        <p>You agree not to use the Payment Services in a manner to infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party's rights, breach any laws or regulations, or breach the Terms of Service.</p>
                        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
                        <p>We may terminate or suspend your use of the Payment Services at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. If we do so, itâ€™s important to understand that you don't have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our Services.</p>
                        <h2>8. Disputes</h2>
                        <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Payment Services will be resolved through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>
                        <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                        <p>We may amend these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on our Platform. The revised version will be effective immediately at the time it is posted unless a delayed effective date is expressly stated therein.</p>
                        <p>By continuing to use the Payment Services after new and/or revised Terms are effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
